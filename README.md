GliderPlane
===========

Independent iOS Application. 
Developed in xCode in 2011. 
Current Status: Uploaded in the Apple App Store for iOS devices.

Summary: This game was developed as an independent project while I was in high school. It is the first iOS project I undertook in order to get more experience as a developer. The purpose of this game is to collect as many point as you can by controlling an airplane to avoid obstacles. The obstacles increase as the more points you get, and at a certain point they begin to move. This project takes advantage of the accelerometer to control the airplane.
